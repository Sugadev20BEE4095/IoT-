 INTRDUCTION:
The system is designed to detect intrusion (unauthorized entry ) into a building or other area. This project can be used in residential, commercial, industrial, and military properties for protection against burglary or property damage, as well as personal protection against intruders
A compact, low budget device is attached to the wall of the area which has to be monitored. This project consists of a PIR Motion Sensor that will detect the presence of the intruder and notify the owner.
To test the real-time scenario, we deployed it in our office to test how possibly it could help us and the results were pretty affirmative

How does it work?
As you know, the NodeMCU is a WiFi-enabled microcontroller, Which can connect to the internet via WiFi. So, using the BLYNK Blynk application, we can activate the device. For this purpose, we connected the button with the virtual pin, so that when the activate button is pressed, the value in the variable "state" will change from "1" to "0" (Refer code).
In the next step, if the "state" is 1, the PIR Sensor starts to check for the intruders. So, whenever an intruder (ie, motion) is detected, the sensor will send a HIGH value to the NodeMCU. When NodeMCU reads a HIGH value, an HTTP request will be sent from the NodeMCU. This HTTP request (WebHooks API) will trigger ClickSend SMS Service, thus we receive the SMS in our Phone as soon as the Motion is Detected
